# Codealong_28_11_23

This is the first and probably last codealong with Marie
The reasons were unclear why Marie and not Stian, but
it was a reasonable codealong, by far the hardest one.
Mostly because of my own negligence but i was never
done with the tast at hand.

## The task.

The task i was handed was to make a horseranch with
different types of horses, they should have different
speeds than the others. One could feed, groom or call
the horse on a race.

## The race.

The horserace for the easiest math possible was a loop,
one loop correspond to one hour, a horse has to run 3
rounds and one round equals to 1000km, and yes I calculated
that a normal horse would have to run 100 hours in
one go to finish the race, because of the avarege speed
beeing around 20-30km/h and 3000km to complete the race.

## Missing.

Well as I said, the task is incomplete, I made some
hard coded line for when you comb or feed the horses and
no calling the horses to the race. The race, I don't
even know if there is a race here. I was not thinking
of how I could use object orientation to simplify the
process.
